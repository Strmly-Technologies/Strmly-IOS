# VideoFeed "Failed to Fetch Videos" - Complete Solution Guide

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The backend API is working correctly. The issue is **authentication-related**:

✅ **Backend Status**: Server is healthy and running  
✅ **API Endpoints**: All endpoints are accessible  
✅ **Authentication**: Required and working properly  
❌ **User Login**: User is not properly authenticated on mobile app  

## 🎯 **The Problem**

The VideoFeed component requires a valid authentication token to fetch videos, but:
1. User may not be logged in
2. Token may have expired (30-day expiry)
3. Token may not be stored correctly
4. User may need to refresh their session

## 🛠️ **Solutions (Try in Order)**

### **Solution 1: Check Login Status**
1. Open the mobile app
2. Look for the **VideoFeedDebug** component in the top-right corner
3. Check if it shows:
   - `Logged In: ✅` 
   - `Token: ✅`
   - `User: [username]`

### **Solution 2: Re-authenticate**
If debug shows no token or user:
1. **Log out** from the app (if possible)
2. **Log back in** with your credentials
3. Try accessing the video feed again

### **Solution 3: Clear App Storage**
If login doesn't work:
1. **Clear app data/storage** in device settings
2. **Restart the app**
3. **Create a new account** or log in again
4. Try accessing videos

### **Solution 4: Create New Account**
If you don't have an account:
1. Go to **Sign Up** screen
2. Create a new account with:
   - Valid email address
   - Strong password
   - Unique username
3. Complete any verification steps
4. Log in and try videos

### **Solution 5: Network Check**
If still not working:
1. Verify your device is on the same network as backend
2. Check if IP `192.168.1.36` is reachable from your device
3. Try restarting the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd Strmly-Backend
   npm start
   ```

## 🔧 **For Developers**

### **Debug the Issue**
1. Check console logs in the mobile app
2. Look for these specific messages:
   ```
   🔧 VideoFeed Debug Info:
   📍 BACKEND_API_URL: [URL]
   🔑 Token exists: [true/false]
   ```

### **Common Error Messages**
- `"Authentication token is missing"` → User not logged in
- `"Authentication failed - please log in again"` → Token expired
- `"Access forbidden - invalid token"` → Token corrupted
- `"Server error: 500"` → Backend issue

### **Test Authentication**
Run this command to test if backend is working:
```bash
node debug/checkBackendHealth.js
```

## 📱 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

Once properly authenticated, you should see:
1. **VideoFeedDebug** showing ✅ for all status items
2. **Videos loading** in the feed
3. **No error messages**
4. **Smooth video playback**

## 🚨 **If Nothing Works**

1. **Restart backend server**
2. **Clear mobile app cache completely**
3. **Try on a different device**
4. **Check network connectivity**
5. **Verify backend logs for errors**

The API is confirmed working - this is purely an authentication/session issue that can be resolved by ensuring the user is properly logged in with a valid token.
