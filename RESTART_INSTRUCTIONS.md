# ðŸ”§ Environment Variable Fix - Restart Required

## Issue
The app was trying to connect to `localhost:8080` instead of `192.168.1.36:8080` because environment variables weren't loading properly.

## What Was Fixed
1. âœ… Updated `.env` file to use `EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL` (Expo requires this prefix)
2. âœ… Updated `Constants/config.ts` to use the correct environment variable
3. âœ… Updated `app.config.js` to pass the correct environment variable
4. âœ… Added debug logs to help troubleshoot

## Required Actions

### 1. Stop the Development Server
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in your terminal to stop the current Expo server
```

### 2. Clear Expo Cache (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# Clear Expo cache
npx expo start --clear

# Or if using npm/yarn
npm start -- --clear
# or
yarn start --clear
```

### 3. Restart the Development Server
```bash
# Start fresh
npx expo start
```

### 4. Check the Debug Logs
After restarting, you should see in the console:
```
ðŸ”§ Environment Variables Debug:
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL: http://192.168.1.36:8080/api/v1
ðŸ”§ VideoFeed API URL: http://192.168.1.36:8080/api/v1
```

If you still see `localhost`, the environment variable isn't loading.

## Alternative: Manual Override (Temporary)
If the environment variable still doesn't work, you can temporarily hardcode it:

```typescript
// In Constants/config.ts - TEMPORARY FIX
export const CONFIG = {
  API_BASE_URL: 'http://192.168.1.36:8080/api/v1', // Hardcoded temporarily
  // ... rest of config
};
```

## Network Configuration
Your current network configuration in `.env`:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL=http://192.168.1.36:8080/api/v1
```

To switch networks, just update this line and restart the server.

## Verification
After restart, the app should:
1. âœ… Connect to `192.168.1.36:8080` instead of `localhost`
2. âœ… Load videos successfully
3. âœ… Show proper debug logs in console
