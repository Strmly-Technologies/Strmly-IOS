# Video Scrolling Issues - iOS Fixes

## Problem Description
After implementing the iOS progress bar fixes, a new issue emerged:
- Only the first video plays when scrolling in GlobalVideoPlayer
- Progress bar doesn't work after scrolling to other videos
- No audio on videos after scrolling
- Videos become unresponsive after scrolling

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. State Management During Transitions
- VideoPlayer components weren't properly resetting their states when becoming inactive/active
- Progress bar states persisted between video transitions
- Player instances retained old state from previous videos

### 2. Audio/Muting Issues
- Player muted state wasn't being properly managed during video transitions
- Active player wasn't being cleared when videos became inactive
- Focus handling wasn't properly managing audio state

### 3. Viewability Configuration
- GlobalVideoPlayer's viewability config was too strict (95% threshold)
- Debounce timing was too slow for smooth transitions
- `waitForInteraction: true` was preventing immediate video activation

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced State Reset in VideoPlayer
```typescript
// Reset states when video changes
useEffect(() => {
  setIsInitialSeekComplete(false);
  setHasBeenActiveBefore(false);
  setIsReady(false);
  setIsBuffering(false);
  setPlayerError(false);
  setAccessChecked(false);
  setCanPlayVideo(false);
  console.log(`VideoPlayer: Resetting states for video ${videoData._id}`);
}, [videoData._id, videoData?.access?.freeRange?.start_time]);

// Reset states when becoming inactive
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isActive) {
    setIsInitialSeekComplete(false);
    setHasBeenActiveBefore(false);
    
    if (player) {
      player.pause();
      player.muted = true;
      clearActivePlayer();
    }
  }
}, [isActive, videoData._id, player]);
```

### 2. Enhanced State Reset in VideoProgressBar
```typescript
// Reset progress bar states when becoming inactive
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isActive) {
    setHasPerformedInitialSeek(false);
    setIsVideoReady(false);
    hasShownAccessModal.current = false;
    modalDismissed.current = false;
    setShowAccessModal(false);
    setCurrentTime(0);
    setIsDragging(false);
    setDragTime(null);
    dragTimeRef.current = null;
    hasUserInteracted.current = false;
  }
}, [isActive, videoId]);
```

### 3. Improved Audio Management
```typescript
// Enhanced playback control with proper audio handling
if (shouldPlay) {
  player.muted = isMutedFromStore;
  player.play();
  setActivePlayer(player);
  usePlayerStore.getState().smartPlay();
} else {
  player.pause();
  if (!isFocused || !isActive) {
    player.muted = true; // Ensure muted when inactive
    clearActivePlayer();
  }
}
```

### 4. Optimized Viewability Configuration
```typescript
const viewabilityConfig = useRef({
  itemVisiblePercentThreshold: 80, // Reduced from 95 for better responsiveness
  minimumViewTime: 50, // Reduced from 100 for faster transitions
  waitForInteraction: false, // Changed to false for immediate response
}).current;
```

### 5. Enhanced Logging for Debugging
Added comprehensive logging throughout the components to track:
- Video activation/deactivation
- State resets
- Playback decisions
- Focus changes
- Audio state changes

## Expected Results

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **All videos play properly**: Each video will start playing when scrolled to
2. **Progress bar works consistently**: Progress bar resets and works for each video
3. **Audio works properly**: Videos will have audio based on mute settings
4. **Smooth transitions**: Videos transition smoothly when scrolling
5. **Proper state management**: Each video starts with a clean state

### ✅ Maintained Features:
1. **iOS progress bar fixes**: All previous iOS compatibility fixes remain
2. **Paid video handling**: Free/paid video logic continues to work
3. **Seek operations**: Enhanced seek operations for iOS remain functional
4. **Access control**: Video access permissions continue to work properly

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Reset Strategy
- **Complete reset on video change**: All player and progress bar states reset when `videoData._id` changes
- **Inactive state cleanup**: Additional cleanup when `isActive` becomes false
- **Proper player cleanup**: Pause, mute, and clear active player when transitioning

### Audio Management Strategy
- **Explicit muting on inactive**: Force mute when video becomes inactive
- **Proper unmuting on active**: Restore mute state from store when becoming active
- **Focus-based audio control**: Handle audio based on screen focus state

### Performance Optimizations
- **Faster viewability detection**: Reduced thresholds for quicker response
- **Immediate activation**: Removed `waitForInteraction` for instant video activation
- **Efficient state updates**: Minimal state updates during transitions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Scroll through multiple videos**: Verify each video plays when scrolled to
2. **Test audio on/off**: Toggle mute and verify audio works on all videos
3. **Test paid videos**: Ensure paid video logic works after scrolling
4. **Test progress bar**: Verify progress bar works and resets for each video
5. **Test orientation changes**: Ensure videos continue working after rotation
6. **Test background/foreground**: Verify proper behavior when app goes to background

## Debugging Features

Added extensive logging with prefixes like:
- `VideoPlayer ${videoData._id}:` for player-specific logs
- `VideoProgressBar: Video ${videoId}` for progress bar logs
- `GlobalVideoPlayer:` for scroll-related logs

This helps identify which video and component is experiencing issues during development and testing.
