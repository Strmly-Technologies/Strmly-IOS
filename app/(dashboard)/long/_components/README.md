# Comment System Implementation

## Overview
The comment system has been completely refactored and fixed to provide a smooth, real-time commenting experience for video content.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Modal Issues
- **Problem**: Comment modal wasn't displaying properly
- **Solution**: Wrapped the modal in a proper `Modal` component with transparent background and slide animation
- **Improvements**: Added proper backdrop press to close, better positioning, and keyboard handling

### 2. API Integration Issues
- **Problem**: Using Next.js environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`) in React Native
- **Solution**: Updated to use proper React Native config from `@/Constants/config`
- **Improvements**: Added proper error handling and fallback to mock data

### 3. Type Safety Issues
- **Problem**: Comments prop was typed as `[{}]` which is too generic
- **Solution**: Updated to use proper `Comment[]` type from the types definition

### 4. State Management Issues
- **Problem**: Complex state management scattered across the component
- **Solution**: Created a custom `useComments` hook to centralize comment logic

## New Features

### 1. Real-time Comments (Ready for API Integration)
- **WebSocket Service**: Created `commentWebSocket.ts` for real-time updates
- **Auto-reconnection**: Handles connection drops with exponential backoff
- **Event Handling**: Supports new comments, updates, and deletions in real-time

### 2. Optimistic Updates
- **Instant Feedback**: Comments appear immediately when posted
- **Error Handling**: Reverts changes if API calls fail
- **Better UX**: Users don't wait for server responses

### 3. Improved UI/UX
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicators during API calls
- **Connection Status**: Live indicator showing WebSocket connection status
- **Better Styling**: Improved layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy
- **Keyboard Handling**: Proper keyboard avoidance and input handling

```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```tsx
import CommentsSection from './_components/CommentSection';

const VideoComponent = () => {
  const [showComments, setShowComments] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => setShowComments(true)}>
        <Text>Open Comments</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>

      <CommentsSection
        isOpen={showComments}
        onClose={() => setShowComments(false)}
        videoId={videoData._id}
        longVideosOnly={true}
        commentss={videoData.comments}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

### With Real-time Updates
The WebSocket connection is automatically established when the component mounts. No additional setup required.

## API Integration

### Implemented Endpoints
1. **GET** `/videos/{videoId}/comments?page=1&limit=10` - Fetch comments with pagination
2. **POST** `/comment` - Add new comment (requires `videoId`, `content`)
3. **GET** `/videos/{videoId}/comments/{commentId}/replies?page=1&limit=5` - Get replies with pagination
4. **POST** `/comments/reply` - Add reply to comment (requires `commentId`, `content`)
5. **POST** `/comments/upvote` - Upvote comment (requires `commentId`)
6. **POST** `/comments/downvote` - Downvote comment (requires `commentId`)
7. **POST** `/replies/upvote` - Upvote reply (requires `replyId`)
8. **POST** `/replies/downvote` - Downvote reply (requires `replyId`)

### WebSocket Endpoint
- **WS** `/ws/comments/{videoId}?token={authToken}` - Real-time comment updates

### Expected WebSocket Messages
```json
{
  "type": "new_comment",
  "comment": { /* Comment object */ }
}

{
  "type": "comment_updated", 
  "comment": { /* Updated comment object */ }
}

{
  "type": "comment_deleted",
  "commentId": "comment_id_here"
}
```

## Testing

Use the `CommentTestComponent` to test the comment functionality:

```tsx
import CommentTestComponent from '@/components/CommentTestComponent';

// Add to your test screen or development area
<CommentTestComponent />
```

## Configuration

The system uses configuration from `@/Constants/config.ts`:
- `CONFIG.API_BASE_URL` - Base URL for API calls
- WebSocket URL is automatically derived from the API base URL

## Mock Data

When APIs are not available, the system falls back to mock data from `@/utils/CommentGenerator.ts`. This ensures the UI can be tested and developed without backend dependencies.

## ✅ Completed Features

1. **Real API Integration**: All comment endpoints are now connected to your backend
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Comments and votes update instantly with rollback on error
3. **Pagination Support**: Comments and replies support pagination
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to mock data when APIs fail
5. **Centralized API Service**: Clean, reusable API service layer

## Next Steps

1. **WebSocket Server**: Implement WebSocket server for real-time updates
2. **Push Notifications**: Add push notifications for new comments
3. **Comment Moderation**: Add reporting and moderation features
4. **Rich Text**: Support for mentions, hashtags, and emojis
5. **Infinite Scroll**: Load more comments/replies as user scrolls
6. **Comment Threading**: Enhanced nested reply system

## Performance Considerations

- Comments are paginated (ready for infinite scroll)
- WebSocket connections are automatically managed
- Optimistic updates reduce perceived latency
- Mock data fallback ensures smooth development experience
